# My Portfolio Project (on-going)

## Description 

Hello! Welcome to my on-going portfolio profile. In this assignment, we were instructed to create a portfolio using advanced css/html to showcase what we have learned so far in the program. This portfolio isn't complete as I want it to be, but throughout my experience in this bootcamp, I hope to update it further to impress any expert software developer that stumbles upon this. 

Overall, my portfolio shares a small background of who I am. Currently I'm employed in my Father's business and helping him as Vice-President of Operations. I included links to our website for the type of service that we do. 

## Code Refractor Examples 

One feature that I'm proud of learning was understanding the functionality of directing the user to a certain portion of the website. 

  <header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#projects">Projects</a></li>
        <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section id="home">
      <h1>Joel Longares Jr</h1>
        <p> Vice President for Longares Global Operations / Atlas Express Padala </p>
        <img src="assets/css/Images/Delivery Man!.jpg" class="image">
    </section>


Understanding how having a class can affect certain portions in the browser. For example, I made a class particular to the image and when you hover over that image, provides a feature of a colored border. 
  
   .axp {
    width: 500px;
    height: auto;
    margin-top: 10px;
  }
  .axp:hover {
    border: 20px solid #d0f0c0
  }
