# My Portfolio Project (on-going)

## Description 

Hello! Welcome to my on-going portfolio profile. In this assignment, we were instructed to create a portfolio using advanced css/html to showcase what we have learned so far in the program. This portfolio isn't complete as I want it to be, but throughout my experience in this bootcamp, I hope to update it further to impress any expert software developer that stumbles upon this. 

Overall, my portfolio shares a small background of who I am. Currently I'm employed in my Father's business and helping him as Vice-President of Operations. I included links to our website for the type of service that we do. 

## Code Refractor Examples 

One feature that I'm proud of learning was understanding the functionality of directing the user to a certain portion of the website. 

  <header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#projects">Projects</a></li>
        <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section id="home">
      <h1>Joel Longares Jr</h1>
        <p> Vice President for Longares Global Operations / Atlas Express Padala </p>
        <img src="assets/css/Images/Delivery Man!.jpg" class="image">
    </section>


Understanding how having a class can affect certain portions in the browser. For example, I made a class particular to the image and when you hover over that image, provides a feature of a colored border. 
  
   .axp {
    width: 500px;
    height: auto;
    margin-top: 10px;
  }
  .axp:hover {
    border: 20px solid #d0f0c0
  }


## Usage 

Provided is a screenshot of the style I added for when you hover over the image that will link to the desginated website.

Provided is a screenshot of how my understanding the usage of adding padding to your css styles helps organize the website to the user's eye.

## Learning Points 

Although that my understanding is still novice, I'm happy to created something out of a blank page. This assignment has helped me that within 1 week of learning, I'm able to make progress on becoming a future software developer. 

Main points that helped me understand this assignment:

Section id ="" is a way to give a special name or identifier to a specific section of a website or a document. 
Understanding that a class attribute can be applied to a specific group or category within elements. Helps organize certain code which helped me a lot to create different segments within the application so that any other user understands what's going on in each segment of the browser without being confused.

I'M JUST REALIZING SOMETHING SO PAINFUL TO WHOEVER IS READING THIS
I was wondering whenever I git add, git commit, git push origin main , the terminal would always say up-to date. Which I thought was weird because I made constant updates via gitbash and was wondering why it kept telling me that I was always up-to date with my work.. realizing that I was on the right main folder the entire time... I happened to be on our mini project assignment that was during lecture....
